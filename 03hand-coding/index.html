    <h1>History of the Piano</h1>
    <p>The piano was born out of an attempt to enhance the harpsichord’s <strong>expressive possibilities.</strong> Invented in Padua, Italy, by renowned harpsichord maker Bartolomeo Cristofori in the 1700s, the piano was initially called the gravicembalo col piano e forte, or “harpsichord that plays soft and loud.” The name referred to the instrument’s ability to change its volume according to the pressure on the keys—an important feature not found on harpsichords. Eventually, the name was shortened to fortepiano or pianoforte, and then, finally, piano. Though the piano gradually made its mark during the 18th century, it was the go-to keyboard instrument by the early 1800s.</p>   
    <p>Little is known about Cristofori’s life, but the few surviving examples of his work provide evidence that he refined the design of the piano over the years. Most notably, Cristofori’s pianos were responsive and featured a wide dynamic range that let players express nuances in their music like never before. <em>Three</em> of Cristofori’s pianos survive today. They can be seen at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, the Museum of Musical Instruments in Germany, and the Museum of Musical Instruments in Italy.</p>

    
    <h2>The First Pianos</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Harpsichord: Eventually developed to sound less like a string instrument</li>
            <li>Hammered Dulcimer, a type of zither that uses small mallets called hammers to strike stretched wires, </li>
            <li>Clavichord uses the same stringed components of the hammered dulcimer, but it incorporates a keyboard that triggers metal blades, called tangents, to strike the strings.</li>
            <li>Steinway: In 1850, Steinweg immigrated to America with his sons to pursue his passion for creating a more perfect piano. Three years later, he changed his name to Henry E. Steinway and officially founded Steinway & Sons.</li>
            <li>Many famous pianos with great historical value are displayed at the Musical Instrument Museum in Phoenix, AZ</li>
