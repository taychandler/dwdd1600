        <h2>Our Story</h2>     
                <p>Budget Vacations was founded by Daniel Budget, a man who had a lifelong passion for exploration and a deep appreciation for the  power of travel. After years of planning his own peaceful getaways, he realized there was a gap in the market for a travel agency focused on creating truly peaceful travel experiences. In 2015, Budget turned his vision into reality. 

                    What began as a small operation catering to friends and family quickly grew into a trusted name in the travel industry. Budget built his reputation on a foundation of care, attention to detail, and a commitment to client satisfaction. Today, Budget Vacations continues to uphold the founders’ original vision, helping travelers find serenity in every corner of the globe.</p>
